# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. This repository contains several projects such as Data Analysis, Machine Learning & Deep Learning models, Data Visualization.

# Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

# Projects
1. [IKN PROPERTY](https://github.com/FTDS-assignment-bay/p2-final-project-ftds-026-rmt-group-001/tree/main)
    - **Description:** The goal of this project is to make a prediction model that will tell users the prices of their house if the user were to sell their house or property in Ibukota Nusantara (IKN).
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Random Forest, Light GBM, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Lasso Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression.
    - **Results:** A regression model that is able to predict the house prices of IKN and its surrounding area. The model chosen was XGBoost with the final result of 83% R2 accuracyâ€“with the lowest error of margin of about 5%.

2. [Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/masayuanandita/portofolio_DS/tree/main/Hotel%20Reservation%20Cancelation%20Prediction)
    - **Description:** Develop a supervised machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict whether
the guest can cancel the reservation.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, Scipy, Hyperparameter Tuning, Streamlit, Huggingface.
    - **Results:** The RF model using GridSearch got 93% on metrics evaluation Recall.
    - **Deployment:** Check huggingface page to real experience [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ananditapram23/hotel_prediction)

3. [Credit Card Default Payment](https://github.com/masayuanandita/portofolio_DS/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Default%20Payment%20Prediction)
    - **Description:** Develop a supervised machine learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict
credit customers experiencing default based on their historical transactions.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikitlearn, Scipy, Streamlit, Huggingface.
    - **Results:** The Logreg model got 97% on metrics evaluation Recall
    - **Deployment:** Check huggingface page to real experience [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ananditapram23/defaultpayment_prediction)

4. [Customer Segmentation Clustering](https://github.com/masayuanandita/portofolio_DS/tree/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20Clustering)
    - **Description:** A clustering model to perform Customer Segmentation from bank credit card data. The data used is information on credit card usage for the last 6 months from Google Big Query
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikitlearn, Huggingface.
    - **Results:** Succesfully clustering customer based on behaviour.

5. [Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/masayuanandita/portofolio_DS/tree/main/Restaurant%20Review%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
    - **Description:** The aim of this project is to create a sentiment analysis model for reviews of a restaurant.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Python, Pandas, NLTK, Wordcloud, Tensorflow, Scikitlearn, Artificiall Neaural Network, Bidirectional GRU, LSTM, Transfer Learning.
    - **Results:** For model using ANN base, Bidirectional GRU and Bidirection LSTM we got great accuracy of 99% for training data.
    - **Deployment:** Check huggingface page to real experience [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ananditapram23/sentiment_review)

6. [Fezzari Sales Report](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/masayu.anandita/viz/FizzareBikesSalesReport2015-2016/Dashboard1)
    - **Description:** Develop Tableau dashboard for Fezzari bikes sales report to make future business decisions.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks use is Tableau

7. [Placesir](https://github.com/placesir/placesir/tree/Machine-Learning)
    - **Description:** A recommendation system application for tourist attractions using Collaborative Filtering.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Pillow, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, Scipy, Django.
